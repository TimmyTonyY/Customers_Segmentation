# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for performing customer segmentation analysis using means, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The main objective of this analysis is to gain insights into customer behavior and segment customers based on their attributes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

- The main analysis script is `customer_segmentation_analysis.py`.
- Modify the script parameters and file paths as per your data and requirements.
- Run the script using `python customer_segmentation_analysis.py`.

## Data

- The data used for this analysis is stored in the `data/` directory.
- Ensure your data is preprocessed and structured according to the requirements of the analysis script.

## Analysis

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Includes statistical summaries, visualizations, and data cleaning/preprocessing steps.
2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
   - Dimensionality reduction technique to identify important features and reduce multicollinearity.
3. **Means-based Segmentation:**
   - Using clustering algorithms such as K-means to segment customers based on their attributes.

## Results

- Results and insights from the analysis are documented in the `results/` directory.
- Visualizations, cluster profiles, and any other relevant outputs are included here.
